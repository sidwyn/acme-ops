# Quarterly Ops Playbook

## Overview

A recurring checklist to plan, execute, and review quarterly operations. Keep this updated periodically.

## Preparation (Weeks 1-2)

- Review last quarter outcomes and action items.
- Confirm budget status and upcoming renewals.
- Validate staffing plans and onboarding needs.

## Execution (Weeks 3-10)

- Track recurring operational metrics.
- Coordinate cross-team dependencies.
- Escalate blockers and document resolutions.

## Review (Weeks 11-12)

- Compile results and share summary.
- Capture lessons learned and improvements.
- Archive key documents and decisions.

## Closeout & Carryover (Weeks 13–14)

- Finalize carryover scope: confirm what rolls into next quarter vs. gets de-scoped.
- Convert lessons learned into concrete playbook changes (add/remove steps, update templates).
- Close out lingering admin items (POs, invoices, contract paperwork, access cleanup).
- Lock the quarter’s artifact set (final metrics snapshot, decision log, retro notes, budget notes).

## Next-Quarter Kickstart (Weeks 15–16)

- Pre-wire next quarter: align on top risks, dependencies, and “must-not-slip” milestones.
- Refresh operating metrics: validate definitions, owners, dashboards, and alert thresholds.
- Reconfirm staffing and onboarding plan; update on-call / ownership maps if applicable.
- Publish a short kickoff note: goals, key dates, owners, and how escalation works.
