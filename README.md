This is the interactive practice repo for Tool School: GitHub 101 - a collaborative article by [Hannah Stulberg](https://hannahstulberg.substack.com/) and [Sidwyn Koh](https://www.pathtostaff.com/).

Hannah writes [In the Weeds](https://hannahstulberg.substack.com/), a newsletter about practical AI workflows to help you get things done - no coding required. Sidwyn writes [Path to Staff Engineer](https://www.pathtostaff.com/), a newsletter with weekly insights on accelerating your software engineering career. Together they wrote this Tool School guide to help non-technical professionals learn GitHub for the first time.
