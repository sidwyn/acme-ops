# acme-ops

The interactive practice repo for [Tool School: GitHub 101](guides/github-101.md) — a collaborative article by [Hannah Stulberg](https://hannahstulberg.substack.com/) and [Sidwyn Koh](https://www.pathtostaff.com/).

Hannah writes [In the Weeds](https://hannahstulberg.substack.com/), a newsletter about practical AI workflows to help you get things done — no coding required. Sidwyn writes [Path to Staff Engineer](https://www.pathtostaff.com/), a newsletter with weekly insights on accelerating your software engineering career. Together they wrote this guide to help non-technical professionals learn GitHub for the first time.

Clone this repo and you get two things: an interactive lesson where you apply the concepts from the article, and the full article itself as a built-in reference guide. The repo is structured so that your AI coding agent acts as your instructor — when you get stuck, just ask. *"How do I open a pull request?"* It walks you through it using the guide you're already learning from.

Works with Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Antigravity, or any other AI coding agent that reads project instructions from markdown files. The repo includes CLAUDE.md files that provide context about the practice exercises and GitHub concepts — rename them to match your tool's convention (such as `AGENTS.md`) and you're set.

## What's in this repo

- **acme/**: Sarah's operations folder from the article examples. Playbooks, procedures, and templates you can practice editing.
- **guides/**: The full GitHub 101 article as a markdown file, plus agent instructions that help your AI coding tool answer your GitHub questions.
- **takeaways/**: Submit your first PR here! Share what you learned.

## Getting Started

1. [Read the article](guides/github-101.md) (or just clone and ask your AI coding agent as you go)
2. Clone this repo: `git clone git@github.com:sidwyn/acme-ops.git`
3. Follow along with the guide
4. Submit your first PR to `takeaways/`

## Using an AI coding agent with this repo

This repo includes CLAUDE.md files that give your AI coding agent context about the practice exercises and GitHub concepts. If you get stuck while following the guide, just ask — it already knows the repo and can help. Rename the CLAUDE.md files to match your tool's convention (ex:`AGENTS.md`) if you're not using Claude Code.
